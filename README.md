# Learning Rust

I am learning the Rust language using [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book) and this contains my notes

## `main()` function

The `main()` function is a special function that is called first in a rust file, basically this
is the heart of your file, this is where everything you want to run should be referenced.

## How to define a function

You can define a function with the syntax:

```rust
fn func_name (your_arg: arg_type, other_arg: arg_type) {
    // ... your stuff here
}
```

## Comments

Comments can be written like this:

```rust
// ... whatever
```

## Cargo

Cargo is the compiler and package manager for Rust. Always use it in a real project.

- a new project can be made with `cargo new project_name`
- you can compile the project with `cargo build`. this will make the executable in `target/debug`
  - for building a release version run `cargo build --release` instead. this will make the executable file in `target/release`
- you can compile and run the executable with `cargo run`
- you can check if the project can be compiled without errors with `cargo check`

## The `!`

You need to put `!` at the end of Rust's in-built methods and functions like `println!`, if you don't it won't consider it as a Rust
in-built method/function but search for function defined `println` in the file.

## Imports

You can import a module like with the `use` keyword like `use std::io`

## Variables

`let` keyword is used to define a variable, for example:

```rust
let apples = 32;
```

Rust will automatically infer the type because it isn't stupid like javascript. By default, these variables are immutable but can be
mutated with the `mut` keyword like so:

```rust
let mut guess = String::new();
```

In the above we are not assigning to `guess` but we are declaring it as a string. Of course, you can also declare it with a value like
`let mut guess = "stuff"`

**NOTE**: Variables are always scoped, use [`const`](#Constants) to define globally.

## String Interpolation

Basically inserting a variable or smh into a string, what we do in javascript, with `${}` inside strings. In Rust, we do it with just `{}`

## Dependencies

You can install dependencies by updating `cargo.toml` with the dep name and version. The next time you then run `cargo run` or
`cargo build` it will get that dep from crates.io

## `match`

It is a bit similar to `switch` in other languages, it takes a condition compares it with an Enum and runs cases based on that.
Here's an example from the Rust docs:

```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}
```

## `loop`

The `loop` keyword indicates an infinite loop unlike condition based `while` & `for` loops. Here's an example from the Rust docs:

```rust
// Infinite loop
loop {
    count += 1;

    if count == 3 {
        println!("three");

        // Skip the rest of this iteration
        continue;
    }

    println!("{}", count);

    if count == 5 {
        println!("OK, that's enough");

        // Exit this loop
        break;
    }
}
```

## Constants

Constants in Rust are sort of like variables, since, here variables are immutable by default, but while variables can be made mutable
with the `mut` keyword, constant are forever immutable. Also, you need to give it a type on initiation unlike variables where it isn't
necessary. Constants can either be scoped or global.

**NOTE**: The naming convention in Rust for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words

Example:

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

## Shadowing

In Rust, you can redeclare a variable, after it has been initially declared, the redeclared value is considered for evaluation by the
compiler. This is called shadowing, as in the new declaration overshadows the inital one (only after the second declaration). For example:

```rust
let x = 5;

println!("The value of x (initial) is: {x}");

let x = x + 1;

println!("The value of x (shadowed) is: {x}");
```

The output would be like this:

```
The value of x (initial) is: 5
The value of x (shadowed) is 6
```

**NOTE**: Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut` because weâ€™ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this
variable without using the `let` keyword. By using let, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable
after those transformations have been completed. (From Rust docs)

With shadowing you can also change a variable's type you cannot do that with mutability.
